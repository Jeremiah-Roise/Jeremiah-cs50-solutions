Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Made no predictions

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
it highly depends on the purpose of the predictions, but it seems to me that the value diminishes after 10000 sims.
