because energy and danceability were high compared to valence I think the listener was probably
pretty happy thoughout the year.

this could be skewed by the moods the listener is in when they choose to listen to music.
it could also be skewed by their general musical taste eg someone may listen to "sad music" but
only because they enjoy it and not because of their mood.
